```

## Usage

For example usage check out the tests for an example ts, cjs and mjs applications.

In your app.js

```js
const startApp = async () => {
  const app = express();
  // add your favorite pre request middleware here
  app.use(await loadDirectory({
    // these fields are optional as sane defaults are provided, but you must pass an object even if you are not overriding any of the defaults.
    controllerPath: path.join(process.cwd(), 'src', 'controllers'),
    defaultControllerGenerator: () => {
      renderer: ({res, data}) => res.send(data),
    }
  }));
  // add your favorite error handling middleware here
  return app;
};

startApp().then(app => app.listen(3000))
```

### Configuring loadDirectory

loadDirectory takes a context argument with several fields you can use to customize the behavior of express-director globally. Note that all of these are optional, but you must pass an object regardless of whether or not you intend to override anything.

#### controllerPath

This is the path to your controllers. Defaults to the current working directory/src/controllers. If your controller root is in a different location you should make sure that this is set to the absolute path of that directory.

#### bundleRoute

This is the express route that your parcel generated assets will be served on. Generally the only need to change this is if it conflicts with an application route. Default is '/bundle'

#### clientSourcePath

This is the path to your client source files if you have included the parcel optional dependencies. A index.css and index.js file will be looked for in this directory and compiled into a working client source using parcel. The path for use in link and script tags will be made available to your handbars templates at cssPath amd jsPath respectively. Defaults to current wroking directory/src/client

#### partialPath

This is the path to your handlbars partials if you are have included the handlebars optional dependency. Defaults to current wroking directory/src/partials

#### defaultControllerGenerator

This is a function that receives the controllers filepath and  returns an object that will be shallowly merged with your controllers to set default values across all your controllers as necessary. For details on the shape of this object check out the controllers section below. Note that the actual controller will override any conflicting values set here.

#### swagger

The swagger field is an object that will be shallow merged with the generated config from your controllers. You can use this to set human readable description/title fields for your api as well asmore specific security handlers and such as necessary. Not that since this is a shallow merge anything under the paths key will be overwritten. You can set this to a falsy value if you wish to disable the autogenerated swagger playground.

#### controllerProcessors

This is an array of controller processors that produce express middlewares to handle the behavior you want out of your controllers. Note that this is very advanced usage and should rarely be needed. If you choose to override this behavior be sure to include the default processors in the list otherwise you controllers might be missing behavior described below.

##### Default Processors


###### prepareRouter

This Processor handles the prepareRouter key on controllers. See below for detailed documentation.

###### processSchemas

This Processor handles the schemas key on controllers. See below for detailed documentation.

###### processHandlerAndResponder

This Processor handles the handler and renderer key on controllers. See below for detailed documentation.

###### processSwagger

This processor handles the swagger key as an override/enhancement to auto generated swagger config.

##### Creating custom processors

Example custom processor:

```js
// in a file called mermission-processor.js
const processor = ({path, controller}) => {
  if (controller.permission) {
    return {
      handlers: [
        async (req, res, next) => {
          try {
            if(req.permissions.includes(controller.permission) {
              return next()
            }

            res.sendStatus(403)
          } catch (e) {
            next(e);
          }
        },
      ],
      swagger: {
        description: `This endpoint requires the ${controller.permission} permission`
      }
    }
  }

  return [];
}

export default processor

// in your main file where express-directory is configured
import loadDirectory, { defaultProcessors } from 'express-directory';
import permissionProcessor from 'src/processors';
const startApp = async () => {
  const app = express();
  app.use(middlewareThatSetsRequestPermissions)
  app.use(await loadDirectory({
    controllerPath: path.join(process.cwd(), 'src', 'controllers'),
    defaultController: {
      renderer: ({res, data}) => res.send(data),
    },
    // note that if you do not include the default processors or include them out of order then YMMV with regards to the rest of the documentation. The only test case run as part of this project is to add new processors to the beginning of the config.
    controllerProcessors: [permissionProcessor, ...defaultProcessors]
  }));
  // add your favorite error handling middleware here
  return app;
};

startApp().then(app => app.listen(3000))


```

Adding your own custom processors allows you to extend the functionality of your controllers to support other nice opt in feature like authentication, logging, audit trail, permissions etc that the library does not yet support. Please feel free to add an issue to the repository if there is some controller key you would like to see added or a custom processor you think the community would benefit from.



### Defining Controllers

To add a route to your application simply add a file with the matching http verb as the name at the path you would like it to be served. So if you wanted to support a POST request to localhost:3000/widget you would create:

```
src/controllers/widget/post.js
```

It is worth noting here that the following keys and documentation relating to them only hold true if the configuration for loadDirectory includes all the default processors.

#### swagger

The swagger key is where you can specify specific openapi keys for this endpoint. Note that usually this is only necessary for odd usecases. Information from your schemas, the route represented by the file path, and the method from the filename are all captured and added to the playground automatically. Typically you would use this to set a custom set of responses or other information not captured in the standard controller configuration.

#### handler

A controller should export a handler function like so:

```js
export default {
  handler: (req, res, next) => {
    // do whatever you would do in a normal express handler here
    // but if you throw an exception it will be caught and forwarded to any error middleware you have defined
    // you can also return a value here and it will be passed to the renderer of the controller or default renderer from the global initialization.
    return { hello: 'world'};
    // by default the above is equivalent to:
    // res.send({hello: 'world'});
  }
}
```

#### renderer

In order to use a custom renderer you can add the renderer key to your controller. The renderer receives a context object that includes the result of your handler. These renderer allow you to standardize output formats by sharing renderer functions across multiple controllers. It is recommended that any custom renderer you write be placed in src/renderers, but this is not enforced by the library in any way.

```js
const controller = {
  handler: () => ({ hi: 5 }),
  // note here that the path here is the relative path from the cwd of the controller file this is useful if you want to grab related resources based on the path of the controller.
  renderer: ({req, res, path, data}) => res.send({ count: data.hi })
};

export default controller;
```

#### schemas

In order to validate your input params you can use the schemas key to apply a JSON schema to the body, params, or query object. The server will return a 400 error with the ajv errors object if the request does not match any of your schemas.

It's worth noting that if you aren't using some form of body parser the body schema might have unpredictable effects as validation is applied to the field on the express request object and not the base data.

```js
export default {
  schemas: {
    body: ajvSchemaForBody,
    params: ajvSchemaForParams,
    query: ajvSchemaForQuery,
  },
  // handler etc goes here
}
```

Using a schema will strip any extra fields from the relevant key on the request object and so you should make sure to add complete schemas for your controllers

If you do specify schemas then the request.validatedData object will be available with an object containing the merged content of your schema fields.

#### prepareRouter

Setting middleware on a path and it's children can be done using the prepareRouter key on an exported controller:

```js
// all.js
export default {
  prepareRouter: (r) => {
    r.use((req, res, next) => {
      res.append('nonsense', 'true');
      next();
    });
  },
};
```

Some caveats to this approach are that in express the order that middleware is added is very important. It is recommended that you set any middleware that you intend to use in the all.js file as it will be the first thing loaded. This way middleware applies to everything below it without weird edge cases. However if your folder contains only one file it may be easier to read with all configuration in the same file, so it is an option to configure the router from any controller.

For clarification if load order is causing problems your files in a particular folder are processed in the following order:

1. All .js files in the directory in lexical order
2. All folders in reverse lexical order depth first

### Html Rendering

By default if you include the optional dependencies for handlebars and parcel express director will serach for .handlebars files matching the controller files and render them using the controllers return value as the input object. 

It will also automatically search for an index.html and index.css file in your clientSourcePath (default: src/client) and compile them using parcel. To use custom parcel options you can add the appropriate config files to your project based on the parcel docs. the paths to the generated src will be available as the cssPath and jsPath variables so that they can be easily added to a layout partial. See the test/mjs-html-app folder for a detailed example project

You can also add shared handlebars partials to the partialPath (default: src/partials) these will be made available automatically.


### Typescript types

In order to facilitate good typing in projects using this package the DefaultController type is exported so that a file can opt in to typechecking in the following way. This will verify all controller keys being set correctly. Please note that if you overwrite the controllerProcessors config option you will have to build your own controller type based on the controller format expected by your list of processors. In order to simplify that process types are exported for each processor that you can combine to create a new controller type. but for most common usecases the DefaultController should suffice.

```js
import { DefaultController } from 'express-director';

const controller: DefaultController = {
  handler: () => ({ hi: 5 }),
};

export default controller;
```

If your endpoint is using schemas then you can pass the appropriate types for your schemas so that ajv typechecking is enabled for your schemas and the validatedData field is detected as the correct type.

```js
import { DefaultController } from 'express-director';

type Params = {
  id: number;
}

type Body = {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
}

type Query = {
  middleName: string;
}

const controller: DefaultController<Query,Body,Params> = {
  schemas: {
    params:  {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        id: { type: 'number', minimum: 100000 },
      },
      required: ['id'] as const,
    },
    query: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        middleName: { type: 'string', minimum: 1 },
      },
      required: ['middleName'],
    },
    body: {
      type: 'object',
      required: ['firstName', 'lastName'],
      properties: {
        firstName: { type: 'string', minimum: 1 },
        lastName: { type: 'string', minimum: 1 },
      },
    },
  },
  // req.validatedData comes back as the merged type of your three schemas
  handler: (req) => req.validatedData.firstName,
};

export default controller;
```

If you are using a custom renderer it will take into account the data field being of your handler result type:

```js
import { DefaultController } from 'express-director';

type HandlerResult = {
  hi: number;
}

const controller: DefaultController<null,null,null, HandlerResult> = {
  handler: () => ({ hi: 5 }),
  renderer: ({res, data}) => res.send({data: { count: data.hi }})
};

export default controller;
```
