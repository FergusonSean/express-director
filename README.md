# Express Director

> Express director is a simple npm package to enable loading a directory as express routes.

## Prerequisites

This project requires NodeJS (version 14 or later) and NPM.
[Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) are really easy to install.
To make sure you have them available on your machine,
try running the following command.

```sh
$ npm -v && node -v
7.24.0
v16.10.0
```

## Installation

To install:

```sh
$ npm install --save express-director
```

Or if you prefer using Yarn:

```sh
$ yarn add express-director
```

## Usage

For example usage check out the tests for an example cjs and mjs application.

In your app.js

```js
const startApp = async () => {
  const app = express();
  // add your favorite pre request middleware here
  app.use(await loadDirectory());
  // or if you prefer to load a different folder than src/controllers
  app.use(await loadDirectory('/absolute/path/to/your/contollers/here'));
  // add your favorite error handling middleware here
  return app;
};

startApp().then(app => app.listen(3000))
```

### Defining Contollers

To add a route to your application simply add a file with the matching http verb as the name at the path you would like it to be served. So if you wanted to support a POST request to localhost:3000/widget you would create:

```
src/controllers/widget/post.js
```

A controller should export a handler function like so:

```js
export default {
  handler: (req, res, next) => {
    // do whatever you would do in a normal express handler here
    // but if you throw an exception it will be caught and forwarded to any error middleware you have defined
    // you can also return a value here and that is the same as calling res.send with it
    // res.send({hello: 'world'}) is the same as:
    return { hello: 'world'};
  }
}
```

Setting middleware on a path and it's children can be done using the prepareRouter key on an exported controller:

```js
// all.js
export default {
  prepareRouter: (r) => {
    r.use((req, res, next) => {
      res.append('nonsense', 'true');
      next();
    });
  },
};
```

Some caveats to this approach are that in express the order that middleware is added is very important. It is recommended that you set any middleware that you intend to use in the all.js file as it will be the first thing loaded. This way middleware applies to everything below it without weird edge cases. However if your folder contains only one file it may be easier to read with all configuration in the same file, so it is an option to configure the router from any controller.

For clarification if load order is causing problems your files in a particular folder are processed in the following order:

1. All .js files in the directory in lexical order
2. All folders in reverse lexical order depth first
