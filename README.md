# Express Director

> Express director is a simple npm package to enable loading a directory as express routes.

## Prerequisites

This project requires NodeJS (version 14 or later) and NPM.
[Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) are really easy to install.
To make sure you have them available on your machine,
try running the following command.

```sh
$ npm -v && node -v
7.24.0
v16.10.0
```

## Installation

To install:

```sh
$ npm install --save express-director
```

Or if you prefer using Yarn:

```sh
$ yarn add express-director
```

## Usage

For example usage check out the tests for an example cjs and mjs application.

In your app.js

```js
const startApp = async () => {
  const app = express();
  // add your favorite pre request middleware here
  app.use(await loadDirectory({
    // these fields are optional as sane defaults are provided, but you must pass an object even if you are not overriding any of the defaults.
    controllerPath: path.join(process.cwd(), 'src', 'controllers'),
    defaultFormatter: ({res, data}) => res.send(data),
  }));
  // add your favorite error handling middleware here
  return app;
};

startApp().then(app => app.listen(3000))
```

### Configuring loadDirectory

loadDirectory takes a context argument with several fields you can use to customize the behavior of express-director globally. Note that all of these are optional, but you must pass an object regardless of whether or not you intend to override anything.

#### controllerPath

This is the path to your controllers. Defaults to the current working directory/src/controllers. If your controller root is in a different location you should make sure that this is set to the absolute path of that directory.

#### defaultFormatter

This is a function that handles formatting if the controller does not specify a formatter. By default just passes the result to res.send. For detailed docs check out the field under defining controllers.

### Defining Controllers

To add a route to your application simply add a file with the matching http verb as the name at the path you would like it to be served. So if you wanted to support a POST request to localhost:3000/widget you would create:

```
src/controllers/widget/post.js
```


#### handler

A controller should export a handler function like so:

```js
export default {
  handler: (req, res, next) => {
    // do whatever you would do in a normal express handler here
    // but if you throw an exception it will be caught and forwarded to any error middleware you have defined
    // you can also return a value here and it will be passed to the formatter of the controller or default formatter from the global initialization.
    return { hello: 'world'};
    // by default the above is equivalent to:
    // res.send({hello: 'world'});
  }
}
```

#### formatter

In order to use a custom formatter you can add the formatter jey to your controller. The formatter receives a context object that includes the result of your handler. These formatters allow you to standardize output formats by sharing formatter functions across multiple controllers. It is recommended that any custom formatters you write be placed in src/formatters, but this is not enforced by the library in any way.

```js
import { Controller } from 'express-director';

const controller = {
  handler: () => ({ hi: 5 }),
  // note here that the path here is the relative path from the cwd of the controller file this is useful if you want to grab related resources based on the path of the controller.
  formatter: ({req, res, path, data}) => res.send({ count: data.hi })
};

export default controller;
```

#### schemas

In order to validate your input params you can use the schemas key to apply a JSON schema to the body, params, or query object. The server will return a 400 error with the ajv errors object if the request does not match any of your schemas.

It's worth noting that if you aren't using some form of body parser the body schema might have unpredictable effects as validation is applied to the field on the express request object and not the base data.

```js
export default {
  schemas: {
    body: ajvSchemaForBody,
    params: ajvSchemaForParams,
    query: ajvSchemaForQuery,
  },
  // handler etc goes here
}
```

Using a schema will strip any extra fields from the relevant key on the request object and so you should make sure to add complete schemas for your controllers

If you do specify schemas then the request.validatedData object will be available with an object containing the merged content of your schema fields.

#### prepareRouter

Setting middleware on a path and it's children can be done using the prepareRouter key on an exported controller:

```js
// all.js
export default {
  prepareRouter: (r) => {
    r.use((req, res, next) => {
      res.append('nonsense', 'true');
      next();
    });
  },
};
```

Some caveats to this approach are that in express the order that middleware is added is very important. It is recommended that you set any middleware that you intend to use in the all.js file as it will be the first thing loaded. This way middleware applies to everything below it without weird edge cases. However if your folder contains only one file it may be easier to read with all configuration in the same file, so it is an option to configure the router from any controller.

For clarification if load order is causing problems your files in a particular folder are processed in the following order:

1. All .js files in the directory in lexical order
2. All folders in reverse lexical order depth first


### Typescript types

In order to facilitate good typing in projects using this package the Controller type is exported so that a file can opt in to typechecking in the following way. This will verify all controller keys being set correctly.

```js
import { Controller } from 'express-director';

const controller: Controller = {
  handler: () => ({ hi: 5 }),
};

export default controller;
```

If your endpoint is using schemas then you can pass the appropriate types for your schemas so that ajv typechecking is enabled for your schemas and the validatedData field is detected as the correct type.

```js
import { Controller } from 'express-director';

type Params = {
  id: number;
}

type Body = {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
}

type Query = {
  middleName: string;
}

const controller: Controller<Query,Body,Params> = {
  schemas: {
    params:  {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        id: { type: 'number', minimum: 100000 },
      },
      required: ['id'] as const,
    },
    query: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        middleName: { type: 'string', minimum: 1 },
      },
      required: ['middleName'],
    },
    body: {
      type: 'object',
      required: ['firstName', 'lastName'],
      properties: {
        firstName: { type: 'string', minimum: 1 },
        lastName: { type: 'string', minimum: 1 },
      },
    },
  },
  // req.validatedData comes back as the merged type of your three schemas
  handler: (req) => req.validatedData.firstName,
};

export default controller;
```

If you are using a custom formatter it will take into account the data field being of your handler result type:

```js
import { Controller } from 'express-director';

type HandlerResult = {
  hi: number;
}

const controller: Controller<null,null,null, HandlerResult> = {
  handler: () => ({ hi: 5 }),
  formatter: ({res, data}) => res.send({data: { count: data.hi }})
};

export default controller;
```
